# 🛒 Grocery Recommendation System  

A sophisticated grocery recommendation system leveraging real **Instacart Market Basket Analysis** data.  
It combines **content-based filtering** and **market basket analysis**, with an interactive **Streamlit dashboard** and **explainable AI** features.  

---

## 📋 Features  

- **Real Instacart Dataset** – authentic grocery shopping data from the Instacart Market Basket Analysis dataset.  
- **Content-Based Filtering** – recommends products based on similarity of features (categories and descriptions).  
- **Market Basket Analysis** – identifies frequently bought-together items using the Apriori algorithm.  
- **Hybrid Recommendations** – combines content-based and association-based approaches for optimal suggestions.  
- **Explainable AI** – provides clear reasoning (e.g., similarity scores, confidence, lift) for recommendations.  
- **Interactive Dashboard** – Streamlit interface with product selection, recommendation settings, and analytics visualizations.  
- **Analytics Visualizations** – charts for popular products, category distributions, and transaction insights using Plotly.  

---

## 📊 Dataset  

The system uses the **Instacart Market Basket Analysis dataset**, containing:  

- **products.csv**: ~50,000 grocery products with names, aisles, and departments.  
- **orders.csv**: Real customer purchase history.  
- **order_products__train.csv**: Products purchased in each order.  

### Dataset Statistics  
- **Products**: ~39,000 unique products (filtered to transactions)  
- **Transactions**: ~25,000 sampled orders (optimized for performance)  
- **Categories**: 21 grocery categories (e.g., Produce, Dairy Eggs, Snacks)  

👉 If real data is unavailable, the system generates **synthetic grocery data** with realistic patterns.

---

## 🔧 Code Features

### Intelligent Data Loading

* Detects and loads CSV files automatically.
* Handles data cleaning and preprocessing.
* Samples 25,000 orders for performance.
* Falls back to synthetic data if files are not found.

### Enhanced Market Basket Analysis

* Adjusted support thresholds for real data patterns.
* Handles sparse transaction matrices.
* Identifies **actual customer shopping patterns**
  *(e.g., "Customers who buy organic bananas also buy organic strawberries").*

### Real Product Recommendations

* **Content-Based**: Suggests similar products based on features.
* **Association-Based**: Recommends products frequently bought together.

**Example:**

* Input: `"Banana"`
* Output:

  * Content: `"Apple"`, `"Orange"` (similar category/features)
  * Market Basket: `"Milk"`, `"Bread"` (frequently bought together)

---

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

**Issue 1: FileNotFoundError**

```
FileNotFoundError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: 'products.csv'
```

✅ Ensure dataset files exist in the specified folder.

**Issue 2: Memory Issues**

```
MemoryError when loading large datasets
```

✅ Reduce sample size in `create_transactions_data()`:

```python
sample_orders = self.orders_df.head(20000)
```

**Issue 3: No Association Rules Found**
⚠️ Try popular products like `"Banana"`, `"Milk"`, `"Bread"`.

**Issue 4: Module Import Errors**

```bash
pip install mlxtend
pip install plotly
```

## 🎯 Demo Script

```python
if __name__ == "__main__":
    recommender = GroceryRecommendationSystem()
    if recommender.load_instacart_data():
        recommender.build_content_based_recommender()
        recommender.build_market_basket_analysis()
        recs, _ = recommender.get_content_recommendations("Banana", 5)
        print("Content recommendations for Banana:")
        for rec in recs[:3]:
            print(f"- {rec['product_name']}: {rec['reason']}")
```

## 🛠️ Code Structure

* **grocery\_recommender.py**: Main application with `GroceryRecommendationSystem` class and Streamlit interface.

### Key Methods

* `load_instacart_data`: Loads and preprocesses dataset.
* `generate_synthetic_data`: Creates fallback synthetic data.
* `build_content_based_recommender`: Builds TF-IDF similarity matrix.
* `build_market_basket_analysis`: Runs Apriori for association rules.
* `get_hybrid_recommendations`: Combines content & association-based recommendations.

---

## ⚠️ Limitations

* **Performance**: Samples 25,000 orders for efficiency; full dataset may require more resources.
* **Data Dependency**: Requires Instacart dataset for real mode.
* **Memory Optimization**: Content-based similarity matrix limited to 5,000 popular products.

---

## 🔮 Future Improvements

* Support larger datasets with **Dask/Spark**.
* Integrate **user profiles** for personalized recommendations.
* Enhance visualizations for **association rule networks**.
* Add **API endpoint** for programmatic access.
